Impact : Detect security weaknesses before attackers do.
An inventoried list of all the devices on your network, with their purpose.
A listing of vulnerabilities for each device.
Preparation for future upgrades.
Established security record for later assessments.

Mitigation: Lessening the likelihood and/or impact of a vulnerability being exploited. 
This is sometimes necessary when a proper fix or patch isn't yet available for an identified vulnerability.
This option should ideally be used to buy time for an organization to eventually remediate a vulnerability.
