impact :  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities continue to remain 
a major threat to web applications as attackers 
exploiting XSS attacks can gain control of the userâ€™s account and steal personal information
such as passwords, bank account numbers,
credit card info, personally identifiable information (PII), social security numbers, and more. 

Mitigation: Sanitize user input: Validate to catch potentially malicious user-provided input. 
Encode output to prevent potentially malicious user-provided data from triggering automatic load-and-execute behavior by a browser
